# Collected lab helper scripts 
These scripts were written in summer 2019 in my first year working in the Levin Lab at Tufts.

**Contents**
1. **BulkCSVCondenser:** Converts folder of tadpole bounding box CSVs into one master CSV with 
centroid coordinates and timepoints, to be fed into TrackMate.
2. **FluorMacro:** ImageJ macro to automate measurement of fluorescent indicator expression in bacterial cell imaging, with customizable cell size filtering, logged brightness/contrast measurements for each image. 
This macro was made to help a neuroscience postdoctoral student.
3. **FluorToExcel:** Converts a given folder into a fully labeled Excel workbook with a sheet for each subfolder of data CSVs. 
This was designed to organize FluorMacro data into Excel workbooks for easy analysis, but can be generalized to condense any folders of CSVs.
